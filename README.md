# Result Grouping

EXT:solrgrouping is a TYPO3 extension that can be used as an addon for the extension "solr" providing Solr result grouping.

Result grouping allows grouping of documents sharing a common field. For each group the most relevant documents are returned.

For example example think about searching in an online store for a common term such as DVD, showing the top 3 results for each category ("TVs & Video", "Movies", "Computers", etc).

The most common use case is to group results by their type, like news, products, images, ... Each group's results are sorted by relevance. Of course you can choose any other field to group by as well.

You can also configure the sorting field within each group.

We would like to thank our [Sponsors](http://www.typo3-solr.com/en/sponsors/our-sponsors/) for enabling us to develop this extension.
Here we will further continue the development as a community project.
Commercial Support can be purchased from [dkd Internet Service GmbH](http://www.dkd.de).
